# Benchmarking Algorithms

This repository contains implementation for sorting and graph-searching methods like:
* mergesort
* quicksort
* breadth-first search
* depth-first search

Algorithms are implemented in Java.  
To build application you will need:
* Java JDK
* Gradle
* IDE or command line

### Gradle Tasks

* To build an application:

`> gradle build`

* To run unit test:

`> gradle test`

* To run sorting algorithms:

`> gradle mainSort`

* To run searching algorithms:

`> gradle mainSearch`
